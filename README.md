##Description
This bash script is setup to download all of the development tools and dependencies I use on a regular basis. It provides a solid Ubuntu 14.04 dev machine after the installations for a host of different setups. This repository and bash script file is parallel with the content I've written about on my blog at [Ubuntu Dev Tools List](http://compositecode.com/docs/ubuntu-dev-tools/). So for a play by play breakdown of all the downloads and installations check out that page.

##Use and Setup
	
1. Download the devbuild.sh script `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Adron/devbuild/master/devbuild.sh`
* Run the script with `sudo sh devbuild.sh`.
